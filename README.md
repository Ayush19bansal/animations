This CSS code provides styling for an image display with a hover effect. Here's a brief explanation:

- The `*` selector applies styles to all elements, setting margins and paddings to 0 and using the border-box box-sizing model.

- The `body` styles ensure that the content is centered both horizontally and vertically on the page, with a black background color.

- The `.container` class styles the container for the image. It sets a fixed width, centers content horizontally and vertically, and applies a reflective effect using `-webkit-box-reflect`.

- The `.container img` styles set the maximum width, border radius, box shadow, and a 3D transform effect (rotating around the Y-axis) for the image. A transition effect is applied for smoother animation.

- The `.container .img-1` class provides specific styling for an image with class "img-1", setting its width and height.

- The `.container:hover img` selector applies a lower opacity to the image when hovering over the container.

- The `.container img:hover` selector adjusts the transform to remove the 3D rotation effect and restore the image's opacity to 1 when hovering directly over the image.

In summary, this CSS code creates a container for an image with a hover effect that reduces the opacity of the image and provides a 3D rotation animation when hovering over it. The image returns to full opacity and no rotation when hovering directly over it.
